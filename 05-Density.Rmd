# Density estimation {#density}

This chapter is on nonparametric density estimation. A classical 
nonparametric estimator of a density is the histogram, which provides
discontinuous and piecewise constant estimates. The focus in this chapter is on 
some of the alternatives that provide continuous or even smooth estimates 
instead. 

*Kernel methods* form an important class of smooth density estimators as
implemented by the R function `density()`. These estimators are essentially 
just locally weighted averages, and their computation is relatively 
straightforward in theory. In practice, different choices of how to implement
the computations can, however, have a big effect on the actual computation time,
and the implementation of kernel density estimators will illustrate three points:

* if possible, choose vectorized implementations in R,
* if a small loss in accuracy is acceptable, an approximate solution 
can be orders of magnitudes faster than a literal implementation,
* the time it takes to numerically evaluate different 
[elementary functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function)
can depend a lot on the function and how you implement the computation.

The first point is emphasized because it results in implementations that 
are short, expressive and easier to understand just as much as it typically results 
in computationally more efficient implementations. Note also that not every
computation can be vectorized in a beneficial way, and one should never go 
through hoops to vectorize a computation. 

Kernel methods rely on one or more *regularization parameters* that must be 
selected to achieve the right balance of adapting 
to data without adapting too much to the random variation in the data. 
Choosing the right amount of regularization is just as important as choosing 
the method to use in the first place. It may, in fact, be more important. 
We actually do not have a complete implementation of a nonparametric estimator 
until we have implemented a data driven and automatic way of choosing the 
amount of regularization. Implementing only the computations for 
evaluating a kernel estimator, say, and leaving it completely 
to the user to choose the bandwidth is a job half done. Methods and implementations
for choosing the bandwidth are therefore treated in some detail in this chapter.

In the final section a likelihood analysis is carried out. 
This is done to further clarify why regularized estimators are needed 
to avoid overfitting to the data, and why there is in general no nonparametric 
maximum likelihood estimator of a density. Regularization of the likelihood 
can be achieved by constraining the density estimates to belong to a family 
of increasingly flexible parametric densities that are fitted to data. This is 
known as the *method of sieves*. Another approach is based on basis expansions,
but in either case, automatic selection of the amount of regularization is just 
as important as for kernel methods. 

## Univariate density estimation {#unidens}

Recall the data on [$\phi$- and $\psi$-angles](#intro-angles) in 
polypeptide backbone structures, as considered in Section \@ref(intro-angles).

(ref:phipsiDenscap2) Histograms equipped with a rug plot of the distribution of $\phi$-angles (left) and $\psi$-angles (right) of the peptide planes in the protein human protein [1HMP](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1HMP).

```{r phipsiDens2, fig.cap="(ref:phipsiDenscap2)", fig.show="hold", out.width="49%", dependson="phipsiLoad", fig.pos="h", echo=FALSE}
phi <- phipsi$phi
psi <- phipsi$psi
hist(phi, prob = TRUE)
rug(phi)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE)
rug(psi)
```

We will in this section treat methods for smooth density 
estimation for univariate data such as data on either the $\phi$- or the 
$\psi$-angle.

We let $f_0$ denote the unknown density that we want to estimate. 
That is, we imagine that the data points $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ are 
all observations drawn from the probability measure with 
density $f_0$ w.r.t. Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. 

Suppose first that $f_0$ belongs to a parametrized statistical model 
$(f_{\theta})_{\theta}$, where $f_{\theta}$ is a density w.r.t. 
Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. If $\hat{\theta}$ is an estimate of 
the parameter, $f_{\hat{\theta}}$ is an estimate of the unknown 
density $f_0$. For a parametric family we can always try to use the MLE
$$\hat{\theta} = \text{arg max}_{\theta} \sum_{j=1}^n \log f_{\theta}(x_j)$$
as an estimate of $\theta$. Likewise, we might compute the empirical mean and variance 
for the data and plug those numbers into the density for the Gaussian
distribution, and in this way obtain a Gaussian density estimate of $f_0$.

```{r psi-gauss, fig.cap="Gaussian density (red) fitted to the $\\psi$-angles."}
psi_mean <- mean(psi)
psi_sd <- sd(psi)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE)
rug(psi)
curve(dnorm(x, psi_mean, psi_sd), add = TRUE, col = "red")
```

As Figure \@ref(fig:psi-gauss) shows, if we fit a Gaussian distribution to the $\psi$-angle 
data we get a density estimate that clearly does not match the 
histogram. The Gaussian density matches the data on the first and second moments, 
but the histogram shows a clear bimodality that the Gaussian distribution by 
definition cannot match. Thus we need a more flexible parametric model than
the Gaussian if we want to fit a density to this data set. 

In nonparametric density estimating we want to estimate the target density, $f_0$,
without assuming that it belongs to a particular parametrized family of densities.

## Kernel methods {#kernel-density}

A simple approach to nonparametric density estimation relies on the approximation
$$P(X \in (x-h, x+h)) = \int_{x-h}^{x+h} f_0(z) \ dz \simeq f_0(x) 2h,$$
which is valid for any continuous density $f_0$. Inverting this approximation
and using the law of large numbers, 

\begin{align*}
f_0(x) & \simeq \frac{1}{2h}P(X \in (x-h, x+h)) \\
& \simeq \frac{1}{2hn} \sum_{j=1}^n 1_{(x-h, x+h)}(x_j) \\
& =  \underbrace{\frac{1}{2hn} \sum_{j=1}^n 1_{(-h, h)}(x - x_j)}_{\hat{f}_h(x)}
\end{align*}

for i.i.d. observations $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ from the distribution $f_0 \cdot m$. 
The function $\hat{f}_h$ defined as above is an example of a kernel 
density estimator with a rectangular kernel. We immediately note that $h$ has 
to be chosen appropriately. If $h$ is large, $\hat{f}_h$ will be flat and close to 
a constant. If $h$ is small, $\hat{f}_h$ will make large jumps close to the observations.

What do we then mean by an "appropriate" choice of $h$ above? To answer this we 
must have some prior assumptions about what we expect
$f_0$ to look like. Typically, we expect $f_0$ to have few oscillations and to be
fairly smooth, and we want $\hat{f}_h$ to reflect that. A too large $h$ will oversmooth
the data relative to $f_0$ by effectively ignoring the data, while a too small $h$ will undersmooth 
the data relative to $f_0$ by allowing individual data points to have large local effects that 
make the estimate wiggly. More formally, we can look at the mean and variance 
of $\hat{f}_h$. Letting $p(x, h) = P(X \in (x-h, x+h))$, it follows that 
$f_h(x) = E(\hat{f}_h(x)) = p(x, h) / (2h)$ while 

\begin{equation} 
V(\hat{f}_h(x)) = \frac{p(x, h) (1 - p(x, h))}{4h^2 n} \simeq f_h(x) \frac{1}{2hn}.
(\#eq:varRect)
\end{equation}

We see from these computations that for $\hat{f}_h(x)$ to be approximately unbiased for any $x$
we need $h$ to be small -- ideally letting $h \to 0$ since then $f_h(x) \to f_0(x)$. 
However, this will make the variance blow up, and to minimize variance we should 
instead choose $h$ as large as possible. One way to define "appropriate" is
then to strike a balance between the bias and the variance as a function 
of $h$ so as to minimize the mean squared error of $\hat{f}_h(x)$.

We will find the optimal tradeoff for the rectangular kernel in Section \@ref(bandwidth)
on [bandwidth selection](#bandwidth). It's not difficult, and you are encouraged 
to try finding it yourself at this point. In this section we will focus on 
computational aspects of kernel density estimation, but first we will generalize
the estimator by allowing for other kernels. 

The estimate $\hat{f}_h(x)$ will be unbiased if $f_0$ is constantly equal to $f_0(x)$ 
in the entire interval $(x-h, x+h)$. This is atypical and can only happen for all $x$
if $f_0$ is constant. We expect the typical situation to be that 
$f_0$ deviates the most from $f_0(x)$ close to $x \pm h$, and 
that this causes a bias of $\hat{f}_h(x).$ 
Observations falling close to $x + h$, say, should thus count less 
than observations falling close to $x$? The rectangular kernel makes a sharp 
cut; either a data point is in or it is out. If we use a smooth weighting 
function instead of a sharp cut, we might be able to include more
data points and lower the variance while keeping the bias small. This is 
precisely the idea of *kernel estimators*, defined generally as

\begin{equation}
\hat{f}_h(x) = \frac{1}{hn} \sum_{j=1}^n K\left(\frac{x - x_j}{h}\right)
(\#eq:kernel-def)
\end{equation}

for a kernel $K : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$. The parameter $h > 0$ is known
as the *bandwidth*. Examples of kernels include the *uniform* or *rectangular kernel* 
$$K(x) = \frac{1}{2} 1_{(-1,1)}(x),$$
and the *Gaussian kernel*
$$K(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}.$$

One direct benefit of considering other kernels than the rectangular is that 
$\hat{f}_h$ inherits all smoothness properties from $K$. Whereas the rectangular 
kernel is not even continuous, the Gaussian kernel is $C^{\infty}$ and so is 
the resulting kernel density estimate. 

### Implementation {#dens-implement}

What should be computed to compute a kernel density estimate? That is, in fact, 
a good question, because the definition actually just specifies how to evaluate 
$\hat{f}_h$ in any given point $x$, but there is really not anything to compute
until we need to evaluate $\hat{f}_h$. Thus when we implement kernel density 
estimation we really implement algorithms for evaluating a density estimate 
in a finite number of points.  

Our first implementation is a fairly low-level implementation that returns
the evaluation of the density estimate in a given number of equidistant 
points. The function mimics some of the defaults of `density()` so that it 
actually evaluates the estimate in the same points as `density()`. 

```{r kern_dens}
# This is an implementation of the function 'kern_dens' that computes 
# evaluations of Gaussian kernel density estimates in a grid of points.
#
# The function has three formal arguments: 'x' is the numeric vector of data 
# points, 'h' is the bandwidth and 'm' is the number of grid points. 
# The default value of 512 is chosen to match the default of 'density()'. 
kern_dens <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  # xx is equivalent to grid points in 'density()'
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  y <- numeric(m) # The evaluations, initialized as a vector of zeros
  # The actual computation is done using nested for-loops. The outer loop
  # is over the grid points, and the inner loop is over the data points.
  for (i in seq_along(xx))
    for (j in seq_along(x))
      y[i] <- y[i] + exp(- (xx[i] - x[j])^2 / (2 * h^2))  
  y <- y / (sqrt(2 * pi) * h * length(x))
  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```

Note that the function returns a list containing the grid points (`x`) where 
the density estimate is evaluated as well as the estimated density 
evaluations (`y`). Note also that the argument `m` above sets the number of 
grid points, whereas `density()` uses the argument `n` for that. The 
latter can be a bit confusing as $n$ is often used to denote the 
number of data points. 

We will immediately test if the implementation works as expected -- in this 
case by comparing it to our reference implementation `density()`. 

```{r kern-dens-fig, dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "kern-dens"), fig.cap = "Kernel density estimates with the Gaussian kernel (left) using R's implementation (black) and our implementation (red) together with differences of the estimates (right).", fig.show='hold', out.width="49%"}
f_hat <- kern_dens(psi, 0.2)
f_hat_dens <- density(psi, 0.2)
plot(f_hat, type = "l", lwd = 4, xlab = "x", ylab = "Density")
lines(f_hat_dens, col = "red", lwd = 2)
plot(f_hat$x, f_hat$y - f_hat_dens$y, 
  type = "l", 
  lwd = 2,
  xlab = "x", 
  ylab = "Difference"
)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:kern-dens-fig) suggests that the estimates computed by our 
implementation and by `density()` are the same when we just visually compare the
plotted densities. However, if we look at the differences instead, 
we see that they are as large as $4 \times 10^{-4}$ in absolute value. This is 
way above what we should expect from rounding errors alone when using 
double precision arithmetic. Thus the two implementations only compute 
*approximately* the same, which is, in fact, because `density()` relies 
on certain approximations for run time efficiency.

In R we can often beneficially implement computations in a vectorized way 
instead of using an explicit loop. It is fairly easy to change the implementation 
to be more vectorized by computing each evaluation in one single line using 
the `sum()` function and the fact that `exp()` and squaring are vectorized.

```{r kern-dens-vec}
kern_dens_vec <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  y <- numeric(m) 
  # The inner loop from 'kern_dens' has been vectorized, and only the 
  # outer loop over the grid points remains. 
  const <- (sqrt(2 * pi) * h * length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(xx))
      y[i] <- sum(exp(-(xx[i] - x)^2 / (2 * h^2))) / const
  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```

We test this new implementation by comparing it to our previous 
implementation.

```{r kern-dens-vec-test, dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "kern-dens-vec")}
range(kern_dens(psi, 0.2)$y - kern_dens_vec(psi, 0.2)$y)
```

The magnitude of the differences are of order at most $10^{-16}$, which is what 
can be expected due to rounding errors. Thus we conclude that up to rounding 
errors, `kern_dens()` and `kern_dens_vec()` return the same on this data set. This is,
of course, not a comprehensive test, but it is an example of one among a 
number of tests that should be considered.

There are several ways to get completely rid of the explicit loops and write 
an entirely vectorized implementation in R. One of the solutions will use the 
`sapply()` function, which belongs to the [family of `*apply()` functions](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functionals.html#functionals-loop)
that apply a function to each element in a vector or a list. In the 
parlance of functional programming the `*apply()` functions are variations 
of the functional, or higher-order-function, known as [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)).

```{r kern-dens-apply}
kern_dens_apply <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  const <- sqrt(2 * pi) * h * length(x)
  y <- sapply(xx, function(z) sum(exp(-(z - x)^2 / (2 * h^2))) / const)
  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```

The `sapply()` call above will apply the function `function(z) sum(dnorm(...` 
to every element in the vector `xx` and return the result as a vector. The 
function is an example of an *anonymous function* that does not get a name and 
exists only during the `sapply()` evaluation. Instead of `sapply()` it is possible 
to use `lapply()` that returns a list. In fact, `sapply()` is a 
simple wrapper around `lapply()` that attempts to "simplify" the result from 
a list to an array (and in this case to a vector). 

An alternative, and also completely vectorized, solution can be based on 
the functions `outer()` and `rowMeans()`.

```{r kern-dens-outer}
kern_dens_outer <- function(x, h, m = 512) {
  rg <- range(x)
  xx <- seq(rg[1] - 3 * h, rg[2] + 3 * h, length.out = m)
  y <- outer(xx, x, function(zz, z) exp(-(zz - z)^2 / (2 * h^2)))
  y <- rowMeans(y) / (sqrt(2 * pi) * h)
  list(x = xx, y = y)
}
```

The `outer()` function evaluates the kernel in all combinations 
of the grid and data points and returns a matrix of
dimensions $m \times n$. The function `rowMeans()` computes
the means of each row and returns a vector of length $m$.  

We should, of course, also remember to test these two last implementations.

```{r kern-dens-outer-test, dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "kern-dens", "kern-dens-vec", "kern_dens-apply", "kern_dens-outer")}
range(kern_dens(psi, 0.2)$y - kern_dens_apply(psi, 0.2)$y)
range(kern_dens(psi, 0.2)$y - kern_dens_outer(psi, 0.2)$y)
```

The natural question is then how to choose between the different implementations?
Besides being correct it is important that the code is easy to read 
and understand. Which of the four implementations above that is best in 
this respect may depend a lot on the background of the reader. If you strip 
the implementations for comments, all four are arguably quite readable, but
`kern_dens()` with the double loop might appeal a bit more to people 
with a background in imperative programming, while `kern_dens_apply()` might 
appeal more to people with a preference for functional programming. 
This functional and vectorized solution is also 
a bit closer to the mathematical notation with 
e.g. the sum sign $\Sigma$ being mapped directly to the `sum()` function
instead of the incremental addition in the for-loop. For 
these specific implementations these differences are mostly
aesthetic nuances and preferences may be more subjective than substantial. 

To make a qualified choice between the implementations we should
investigate if they differ in terms of run time and memory consumption.

### Benchmarking

Benchmarking is about measuring and comparing performance. For software
this often means measuring run time and memory usage, though there are clearly 
many other aspects of software that should be benchmarked in general. This 
includes user experience, energy consumption and implementation and maintenance 
time. In this section we focus on benchmarking run time.

The function `system.time` in R provides a simple way of benchmarking run time
measured in seconds.

```{r kern-dens-time, echo=c(7, 9, 11, 13), dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "kern-dens", "kern-dens-vec", "kern-dens-apply", "kern-dens-outer"), results='hold'}
# Evaluations to trigger JIT compilation
invisible(kern_dens(psi, 0.2))
invisible(kern_dens_vec(psi, 0.2))
invisible(kern_dens_apply(psi, 0.2))
invisible(kern_dens_outer(psi, 0.2))
cat("kern_dens:\n")
system.time(kern_dens(psi, 0.2))
cat("kern_dens_vec:\n")
system.time(kern_dens_vec(psi, 0.2))
cat("kern_dens_apply:\n")
system.time(kern_dens_apply(psi, 0.2))
cat("kern_dens_outer:\n")
system.time(kern_dens_outer(psi, 0.2))
```

The "elapsed" time is the total run time as experienced, while the "user" and 
"system" times are how long the CPU spent on executing your code and 
operating system code on behalf of your code, respectively. 

From this simple benchmark, `kern_dens()` is clearly substantially slower
than the three other implementations. For more systematic benchmarking of run 
time, the R package microbenchmark is useful.

```{r microbenchmark, cache=FALSE}
library(microbenchmark)
```

```{r kern-bench, echo=-1, dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "kern-dens", "kern-dens-vec", "kern-dens-apply", "kern-dens-outer")}
set.seed(2345)
kern_bench <- microbenchmark(
  kern_dens(psi, 0.2),
  kern_dens_vec(psi, 0.2),
  kern_dens_apply(psi, 0.2),
  kern_dens_outer(psi, 0.2)
)
```

The result stored in `kern_bench()` is a data frame with two columns. The first 
contains the R expressions evaluated, and the second is the evaluation 
time measured in nanoseconds. Each of the four expressions were evaluated 100 times, 
and the data frame thus has 400 rows. The `times` argument to `microbenchmark()` 
can be used to change the number of evaluations per expression if needed.

It may not be immediately obvious that `kern_bench()` 
is a data frame, because printing will automatically summarize the 
data, but the actual data structure is revealed by the R function `str()`.

```{r bench-str, dependson="kern-bench"}
str(kern_bench)
```

A total of 400 evaluations were done for the above benchmark, and `microbenchmark()`  
does the evaluations in a random order by default. Measuring evaluation time on a 
complex system like a modern computer is an empirical science, and 
the order of evaluation can potentially affect the results as the 
conditions for the evaluation change over time. The purpose of the 
randomization is to avoid that the ordering causes systematically 
misleading results.  

The microbenchmark package implements some methods for summarizing and 
printing the results such as the following summary table with times in 
milliseconds.

```{r kern-bench-hidden, echo=FALSE, dependson="kern-bench"}
old_options <- options(digits = 3)
kern_bench
options(digits = old_options$digits)
```

The summary table shows some key statistics like median and mean evaluation 
times but also extremes and upper and lower quartiles. The distributions
of run times can be investigated further using the `autoplot()` function, which is 
based on ggplot2 and thus easy to modify. 

```{r kern-bench-autoplot, dependson="kern-bench-hidden", message=FALSE}
autoplot(kern_bench) + 
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(0.2, 0), 
              aes(color = expr), alpha = 0.4) + 
  aes(fill = I("gray")) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This more refined benchmark study does not change our initial impression from 
using `system.time()` substantially. The function `kern_dens()` is notably
slower than the three vectorized implementations, but we are now able to 
more clearly see the minor differences among them. For instance, `kern_dens_vec()`
and `kern_dens_apply()` have very similar run time distributions, while 
`kern_dens_outer()` clearly has a larger median run time and also a
run time distribution that is more spread out to the right. 

In many cases when we benchmark run time it is of interest 
to investigate how run time depends on various parameters. This is so 
for kernel density estimation, where we want to understand how changes in 
the number of data points, $n$, and the number of grid points, $m$, affect
run time. We can still use `microbenchmark()` for running the benchmark 
experiment, but we will typically process and plot the benchmark data afterwards 
in a customized way. 


```{r kern-bench-grid, dependson=c("kern-dens", "kern.dens-vec", "kern-dens-apply", "kern-dens-outer"), echo=FALSE}
conf <- expand.grid(
  fun = c("kern_dens", "kern_dens_vec", "kern_dens_apply", "kern_dens_outer"),
  n = 2^(5:11), 
  m = 2^c(5, 7, 9, 11)
)

set.seed(1234)
x <- rnorm(2^11)
calls <- paste0(conf[, 1], "(x[1:", conf[, 2], "], h = 0.2, m = ", conf[, 3], ")")
expr_list <- lapply(calls, function(x) parse(text = x)[[1]])

kern_benchmarks <- microbenchmark(list = expr_list, times = 40L)
```

```{r kern-bench-fig, dependson="kern-bench-grid", fig.cap="Median run times for the four different implementations of kernel density estimation. The dashed gray line is a reference line with slope 1.", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
class(kern_benchmarks) <- "data.frame"
kern_benchmarks <- dplyr::bind_cols(conf, expr = calls) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(kern_benchmarks, .)

kern_benchmarks$m <- factor(
  kern_benchmarks$m, 
  levels = c(32, 128, 512, 2048),
  labels = c("m = 32", "m = 128", "m = 512", "m = 2048")
)

ggplot(kern_benchmarks, aes(x = n, y = time, color = fun)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 15, slope = 1, color = "gray", linetype = 2) +
  stat_summary(fun = "median", geom = "line") + 
  stat_summary(fun = "median", geom = "point") + 
  facet_wrap(~ m) + 
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + 
  scale_y_continuous("Time (ms)", trans = "log2", 
                     breaks = c(1e5, 1e6, 1e7, 1e8), 
                     labels = c("0.1", "1", "10", "100")) +
  scale_color_discrete("Function:") + 
  theme(legend.position="top")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:kern-bench-fig) shows median run times for an experiment with 
28 combinations of parameters for each of the four different implementations 
yielding a total of 112 different R expressions being benchmarked. The number of replications 
for each expression was set to 40. The results confirm that `kern_dens()` 
is substantially slower than the vectorized implementations for all combinations 
of $n$ and $m$. However, Figure \@ref(fig:kern-bench-fig) also reveals a new 
pattern; `kern_dens_outer()` appears to scale with $n$ in a slightly different way 
than the two other vectorized implementations for small $n$. It is comparable to
or even a bit faster than
`kern_dens_vec()` and `kern_dens_apply()` for very small data sets, while it becomes 
slower for the larger data sets. 

Run time for many algorithms have to a good approximation a dominating 
power law behavior as a function of typical size parameters, that is, the 
run time will scale approximately like $n \mapsto C n^a$ for constants $C$ and $a$
and with $n$ denoting a generic size parameter. Therefore it is 
beneficial to plot run time using log-log scales and to design benchmark studies
with size parameters being equidistant on a log-scale. With approximate power 
law scaling, the log run time behaves like
$$\log(C) + a \log(n),$$
that is, on a log-log scale we see approximate straight lines. The slope 
reveals the exponent $a$, and two different algorithms for solving the 
same problem might have different exponents and thus different slopes 
on the log-log-scale. Two different implementations of the same 
algorithm should have approximately the same slope 
but may differ in the constant $C$ depending upon how efficient the 
particular implementation is in the particular programming language used.
Differences in $C$ correspond to vertical translations on the log-log scale. 

In practice, we will see some deviations from straight lines on the log-log plot
for a number of reasons. Writing the run time as $C n^a + R(n)$, 
the residual term $R(n)$ will often be noticeable or even dominating and positive 
for small $n$. It is only for large enough $n$ 
that the power law term, $C n^a$, will dominate. In addition, run time 
can be affected by hardware constraints such as cache and memory sizes, which 
can cause abrupt jumps in run time.  

Using `microbenchmark()` over `system.time()` has two main benefits. First,
it handles the replication and randomization automatically, which is 
convenient. Second, it attempts to provide more accurate timings. The latter
is mostly important when we benchmark very fast computations. 

It can be [debated if a median summary of randomly ordered evaluations](https://radfordneal.wordpress.com/2014/02/02/inaccurate-results-from-microbenchmark/) 
is the best way to summarize run time. This is due to the way R does memory 
management. R allocates and deallocates memory automatically 
and uses [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
for the deallocation. This means that computations occasionally, and in a somewhat 
unpredictable manner, trigger the garbage collector, and as a result a small 
fraction of the evaluations may take substantially longer time than the 
rest. The median will typically be almost unaffected, and memory deallocation 
is thus effectively (and wrongly) disregarded from run time when the median 
summary is used. This is an argument for using the mean instead of the median, 
but due to the randomization the computation that triggered 
the garbage collector might not be the one that caused the memory allocation 
in the first place. Using the mean instead of the median will therefore smear 
out the garbage collection run time on all benchmarked expressions. Setting
the argument `control = list(order = "block")` for `microbenchmark()` will 
evaluate the expressions in blocks, which in combination with a mean 
summary more correctly accounts for memory allocation and deallocation in the 
run time. The downside is that without the randomization the results might 
suffer from other artefacts. This book will use randomization 
and median summaries throughout, but we keep in mind that this 
could underestimate actual average run time depending upon how much 
memory a given computation requires. Memory usage and how it affects 
run time by triggering garbage collection will be dealt with via 
code profiling tools instead. 

## Bandwidth selection {#bandwidth}

### Revisiting the rectangular kernel {#rectangular}

We return to the rectangular kernel and compute the mean squared error. In the 
analysis it may be helpful to think about $n$ large and $h$ small. Indeed, 
we will eventually choose $h = h_n$ as a function of $n$ such 
that as $n \to \infty$ we have $h_n \to 0$. We should also note the $f_h(x) = E (\hat{f}_h(x))$
is a density, thus $\int f_h(x) \mathrm{d}x = 1$. 

We will assume that $f_0$ is sufficiently differentiable 
and use a Taylor expansion of the distribution function $F_0$ to get that

\begin{align*}
f_h(x) & = \frac{1}{2h}\left(F_0(x + h) - F_0(x - h)\right) \\
& = \frac{1}{2h}\left(2h f_0(x) + \frac{h^3}{3!} f_0''(x) + R_0(x,h) \right) \\
& = f_0(x) + \frac{h^2}{6} f_0''(x) + R_1(x,h) 
\end{align*}

where $R_1(x, h) = o(h^2)$. One should note how the quadratic terms in $h$ 
in the Taylor expansion canceled. This gives the following formula for 
the squared bias of $\hat{f}_h$.

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{bias}(\hat{f}_h(x))^2 & = (f_h(x) - f_0(x))^2 \\
& = \left(\frac{h^2}{6} f_0''(x) + R_1(x,h) \right)^2 \\
& = \frac{h^4}{36} f_0''(x)^2 + R(x,h)
\end{align*}

where $R(x,h) = o(h^4)$. For the variance we see from \@ref(eq:varRect)
that 
$$V(\hat{f}_h(x)) = f_h(x)\frac{1}{2hn} - f_h(x)^2 \frac{1}{n}.$$
Integrating the sum of the bias and the variance over $x$ gives the 
integrated mean squared error

\begin{align*}
\mathrm{MISE}(h) & = \int \mathrm{bias}(\hat{f}_h(x))^2 + V(\hat{f}_h(x)) \mathrm{d}x \\
& = \frac{h^4}{36} \|f_0''\|^2_2 + \frac{1}{2hn} + \int R(x,h) \mathrm{d} x - 
\frac{1}{n} \int f_h(x)^2 \mathrm{d} x.
\end{align*}

If $f_h(x) \leq C$ (which happens if $f_0$ is bounded),
$$\int f_h(x)^2 \mathrm{d} x \leq C \int f_h(x) \mathrm{d} x = C,$$
and the last term is $o((nh)^{-1})$. The second last term is $o(h^4)$ 
if we can interchange the limit and integration order. It is conceivable
that we can do so under suitable assumptions on $f_0$, but we will not pursue 
those at this place. The sum of the two remaining and asymptotically dominating terms in 
the formula for MISE is   
$$\mathrm{AMISE}(h) = \frac{h^4}{36} \|f_0''\|^2_2 + \frac{1}{2hn},$$
which is known as the asymptotic mean integrated squared error. Clearly, 
for this to be a useful formula, we must assume $\|f_0''\|_2^2 < \infty$. 
In this case the formula for AMISE can be used to find the asymptotic 
optimal tradeoff between (integrated) bias and variance. Differentiating w.r.t. $h$ we 
find that
$$\mathrm{AMISE}'(h) = \frac{h^3}{9} \|f_0''\|^2_2 - \frac{1}{2h^2n},$$
and solving for $\mathrm{AMISE}'(h) = 0$ yields 
$$h_n = \left(\frac{9}{2 \|f_0''\|_2^2}\right)^{1/5} n^{-1/5}.$$
When AMISE is regarded as a function of $h$ we observe that 
it tends to $\infty$ for $h \to 0$ as well as for $h \to \infty$, thus the unique 
stationary point $h_n$ is a unique global minimizer. Choosing the bandwidth to 
be $h_n$ will therefore minimize the asympototic mean integrated squared error, and it 
is in this sense an optimal choice of bandwidth.

We see how "wiggliness" of $f_0$ enters into the formula for the optimal 
bandwidth $h_n$ via $\|f_0''\|_2$. This norm of the second derivative 
is precisely a quantification of how much $f_0$ oscillates. A large value, 
indicating a wiggly $f_0$, will drive the optimal bandwidth down whereas
a small value will drive the optimal bandwidth up. 

We should also observe that if we plug the optimal bandwidth into the formula
for AMISE, we get 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{AMISE}(h_n) & = \frac{h_n^4}{36} \|f_0''\|^2_2 + \frac{1}{2h_n n} \\
& = C n^{-4/5},
\end{align*}
which indicates that in terms of integrated mean squared error the rate 
at which we can nonparametrically estimate 
$f_0$ is $n^{-4/5}$. This should be contrasted to the common parametric
rate of $n^{-1}$ for mean squared error. 

From a practical viewpoint there is one major problem with the optimal 
bandwidth $h_n$; it depends via $\|f_0''\|^2_2$ upon the unknown $f_0$ 
that we are trying to estimate. We therefore refer to $h_n$ as an *oracle* 
bandwidth -- it is the bandwidth that an oracle that knows $f_0$ would 
tell us to use. In practice, we will have to come up with an estimate 
of $\|f_0''\|^2_2$ and plug that estimate into the formula for $h_n$.
We pursue a couple of different options for doing so for general kernel 
density estimators below together with methods that do not rely on the 
AMISE formula. 

### ISE, MISE and MSE for kernel estimators

Bandwidth selection for general kernel estimators can be studied 
asymptotically just as above. To this end it is useful to formalize 
how we quantify the *quality* of an estimate $\hat{f}_h$. One natural 
quantification is the *integrated squared error*,
$$\mathrm{ISE}(\hat{f}_h) = \int (\hat{f}_h(x) - f_0(x))^2 \ \mathrm{d}x = \|\hat{f}_h - f_0\|_2^2.$$ 

The quality of the estimation procedure producing $\hat{f}_h$ from data
can then be quantified by taking the mean ISE,
$$\mathrm{MISE}(h) = E(\mathrm{ISE}(\hat{f}_h)),$$
where the expectation integral is over the data. Using Tonelli's theorem 
we may interchange the expectation and the integration over $x$ to 
get 
$$\mathrm{MISE}(h) = \int \mathrm{MSE}_x(h) \ \mathrm{d}x$$ 
where 
$$\mathrm{MSE}_h(x) = \mathrm{var}(\hat{f}_h(x)) + \mathrm{bias}(\hat{f}_h(x))^2.$$
is the pointwise mean squared error. 

Using the same kind of Taylor expansion argument as above we can show that if 
$K$ is a square integrable probability density with mean 0 and 
$$\sigma_K^2 = \int z^2 K(z) \ \mathrm{d}z > 0,$$
then
$$\mathrm{MISE}(h) = \mathrm{AMISE}(h) + o((nh)^{-1} + h^4)$$
where the *asymptotic mean integrated squared error* is 
$$\mathrm{AMISE}(h) = \frac{\|K\|_2^2}{nh} + \frac{h^4 \sigma^4_K \|f_0''\|_2^2}{4}$$
with 
$$\|g\|_2^2 = \int g(z)^2 \ \mathrm{d}z  \quad (\mathrm{squared } \ L_2\mathrm{-norm}).$$
Some regularity assumptions on $f_0$ are necessary, and from the result 
we clearly need to require that $f_0''$ is meaningful and square integrable. 
However, that is also enough. See Proposition A.1 in @Tsybakov:2009 for a rigorous 
proof. 

By minimizing $\mathrm{AMISE}(h)$ we derive the optimal oracle bandwidth 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:oracle)
h_n = \left( \frac{\|K\|_2^2}{ \|f_0''\|^2_2  \sigma_K^4} \right)^{1/5} n^{-1/5}.
\end{equation}

If we plug this formula into the formula for AMISE we arrive at the asymptotic 
error rate $\mathrm{AMISE}(h_n) = C n^{-4/5}$ with a constant $C$ depending on 
$f_0''$ and the kernel. It is noteworthy that the asymptotic analysis can be carried 
out even if $K$ is allowed to take negative values, though the resulting estimate 
may not be a valid density as it is. @Tsybakov:2009 demonstrates how to improve on 
the rate $n^{-4/5}$ by allowing for kernels whose moments of order two or above vanish. 
Necessarily, such kernels must take negative values. 

We observe that for the rectangular kernel, 
$$\sigma_K^4 = \left(\frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^1 z^2 \ \mathrm{d} z\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}$$
and 
$$\|K\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2^2} \int_{-1}^1 \ \mathrm{d} z = \frac{1}{2}.$$
Plugging these numbers into \@ref(eq:oracle) we find the oracle bandwidth for 
the rectangular kernel as derived in Section \@ref(rectangular). For the Gaussian
kernel we find that $\sigma_K^4 = 1$, while 
$$\|K\|_2^2 = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int e^{-x^2} \ \mathrm{d} x = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{\pi}}.$$ 

### Plug-in estimation of the oracle bandwidth

To compute $\|f_0''\|^2_2$ that enters into the formula for the asymptotically optimal 
bandwidth we have to know $f_0$ that we are trying to estimate in the first place. 
To resolve the circularity we will make a first guess of what $f_0$ is and plug that 
guess into the formula for the oracle bandwidth. 

Our first guess is that $f_0$ is Gaussian with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$. 
Then 

\begin{align*}
\|f_0''\|^2_2 & = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma^2} \int \left(\frac{x^2}{\sigma^4} -  \frac{1}{\sigma^2}\right)^2 e^{-x^2/\sigma^2} \ \mathrm{d}x \\
& = \frac{1}{2 \sigma^9 \sqrt{\pi}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \sigma^2}} \int (x^4 - 2 \sigma^2 x^2 + \sigma^4) e^{-x^2/\sigma^2} \ \mathrm{d}x \\ 
& = \frac{1}{2 \sigma^9 \sqrt{\pi}} (\frac{3}{4} \sigma^4 - \sigma^4 + \sigma^4) \\
& = \frac{3}{8 \sigma^5 \sqrt{\pi}}.
\end{align*}

Plugging this expression for the squared 2-norm of the second derivative of the density 
into the formula for the oracle bandwidth gives 

\begin{equation}
(\#eq:oracle-silverman)
h_n = \left( \frac{8 \sqrt{\pi} \|K\|_2^2}{3 \sigma_K^4} \right)^{1/5} \sigma n^{-1/5},
\end{equation}

with $\sigma$ the only quantity depending on the unknown density $f_0$. We can now
simply estimate $\sigma$, using e.g. the empirical standard 
deviation $\hat{\sigma}$, and plug this estimate into the formula above to get an 
estimate of the oracle bandwidth. 

It is well known that the empirical standard deviation is sensitive to outliers,
and if $\sigma$ is overestimated for that reason, the bandwidth will be too large
and the resulting estimate will be oversmoothed. To
get more robust bandwidth selection, @Silverman:1986 suggested using 
the interquartile range to estimate $\sigma$. In fact, he suggested 
estimating $\sigma$ by
$$\tilde{\sigma} = \min\{\hat{\sigma}, \mathrm{IQR} / 1.34\}.$$
In this estimator, IQR denotes the empirical interquartile range, and
$1.34$ is approximately the interquartile range, $\Phi^{-1}(0.75) - \Phi^{-1}(0.25)$, 
of the standard Gaussian distribution. Curiously, the interquartile range for 
the standard Gaussian distribution is $1.35$ to two decimals accuracy, but the 
use of $1.34$ in the estimator $\tilde{\sigma}$
has prevailed. Silverman, moreover, suggested to reduce the kernel-dependent 
constant in the formula \@ref(eq:oracle-silverman) for $h_n$ to further reduce
oversmoothing. 

If we specialize to the Gaussian kernel, formula \@ref(eq:oracle-silverman) 
simplifies to 
$$\hat{h}_n = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{1/5} \tilde{\sigma} n^{-1/5},$$
with $\tilde{\sigma}$ plugged in as a robust estimate of $\sigma$. @Silverman:1986 
made the ad hoc suggestion to reduce the factor $(4/3)^{1/5} \simeq 1.06$ to $0.9$.
This results in the bandwidth estimate 
$$\hat{h}_n = 0.9 \tilde{\sigma} n^{-1/5},$$
which has become known as *Silverman's rule of thumb*.  

Silverman's rule of thumb is the default bandwidth estimator for `density()`
as implemented by the function `bw.nrd0()`. The `bw.nrd()` function implements 
bandwidth selection using the factor $1.06$ instead of $0.9$. Though the theoretical 
derivations behind these implementations assume that $f_0$ 
is Gaussian, either will give reasonable bandwidth selection for a range of 
unimodal distributions. If $f_0$ is multimodal, Silverman's 
rule of thumb is known to oversmooth the density estimate.  

Instead of computing $\|f_0''\|^2_2$ assuming that the distribution is Gaussian,
we can compute the norm for a pilot estimate, $\tilde{f}$, and plug the result 
into the formula for $h_n$. If the pilot estimate is a kernel estimate with 
kernel $H$ and bandwidth $r$ we get 
$$\|\tilde{f}''\|^2_2 = \frac{1}{n^2r^6} \sum_{i = 1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n 
\int H''\left( \frac{x - x_i}{r} \right) H''\left( \frac{x - x_j}{r} \right) \mathrm{d} x.$$
The problem is, of course, that now we have to choose the pilot bandwidth
$r$. But doing so using a simple method like Silverman's rule of thumb at this 
stage is typically not too bad an idea. Thus we arrive at the following 
plug-in procedure using the Gaussian kernel for the pilot estimate:

* Compute an estimate, $\hat{r}$, of the pilot bandwidth using Silverman's 
rule of thumb.
* Compute $\|\tilde{f}''\|^2_2$ using the Gaussian kernel as pilot kernel $H$ and 
using the estimated pilot bandwidth $\hat{r}$.
* Plug $\|\tilde{f}''\|^2_2$ into the oracle bandwidth formula \@ref(eq:oracle)
to compute $\hat{h}_n$ for the kernel $K$. 

Note that to use a pilot kernel different from the Gaussian we have 
to adjust the constant 0.9 (or 1.06) in Silverman's rule of thumb accordingly 
by computing $\|H\|_2^2$ and $\sigma_H^4$ and using \@ref(eq:oracle-silverman). 

@Sheather:1991 took these plug-in ideas a step further and analyzed in detail 
how to choose the pilot bandwidth in a good and data adaptive way. The resulting
method is somewhat complicated but implementable. We skip the details but simply 
observe that their method is implemented in R in the function `bw.SJ()`, and
it can be selected when using `density()` by setting the argument `bw = "SJ"`. 
This plug-in method is regarded as a solid default that performs well for 
many different data generating densities $f_0$. 

### Cross-validation {#cv}

An alternative to relying on the asymptotic optimality arguments for 
integrated mean squared error and the corresponding plug-in estimates 
of the bandwidth is known as *cross-validation*. The method mimics 
the idea of setting aside a subset of the data set, which is then *not*
used for computing an estimate but only for validating the estimator's 
performance. The benefit of cross-validation over simply setting 
aside a validation data set is that we do not "waste" any of the data points
on validation only. All data points are used for the ultimate computation
of the estimate. The deficit is that cross-validation is usually 
computationally more demanding. 

Suppose that $I_1, \ldots, I_k$ form a partition of the index set $\{1, \ldots, n\}$
and define 
$$I^{-i} = \bigcup_{l: i \not \in I_l} I_l.$$
That is, $I^{-i}$ contains all indices but those that belong to the set $I_l$ 
containing $i$. In particular, $i \not \in I^{-i}$. Define also $n_i = |I^{-i}|$
and 
$$\hat{f}^{-i}_h = \frac{1}{h n_i} \sum_{j \in I^{-i}} K\left(\frac{x_i - x_j}{h}\right).$$
That is, $\hat{f}^{-i}_h$ is the kernel density estimate based on data with 
indices in $I^{-i}$ and evaluated in $x_i$. Since the density 
estimate evaluated in $x_i$ is not based on $x_i$, the quantity $\hat{f}^{-i}_h$ 
can be used to assess how well the density estimate computed using a bandwidth
$h$ concur with the data point $x_i$. This can be summarized using the 
log-likelihood 
$$\ell_{\mathrm{CV}}(h) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log (\hat{f}^{-i}_h),$$
that we will refer to as the cross-validated log-likelihood, and we define 
the bandwidth estimate as
$$\hat{h}_{\mathrm{CV}} = \textrm{arg max}_h \ \ \ell_{\mathrm{CV}}(h).$$
This cross-validation based bandwidth can then be used for computing kernel 
density estimates using the entire data set. 

If the partition of indices consists of $k$ subsets we usually talk about 
$k$-fold cross-validation. If $k = n$ so that all subsets consist of just a single 
index we talk about leave-one-out cross-validation. For leave-one-out 
cross-validation there is only one possible partition, while for $k < n$ 
there are many possible partitions. Which should be chosen then? In practice, 
we choose the partition by sampling indices randomly without replacement 
into $k$ sets of size roughly $n / k$. 

It is also possible to use cross-validation in combination with MISE. Rewriting 
we find that 
$$\mathrm{MISE}(h) = E (\| \hat{f}_h\|_2^2) - 2 E (\hat{f}_h(X)) + E(\|f_0^2\|_2^2)$$ 
for $X$ a random variable independent of the data and with distribution having 
density $f_0$. The last term does not depend upon $h$ and we can ignore it from
the point of view of minimizing MISE. For the first term we have an unbiased 
estimate in $\| \hat{f}_h\|_2^2$. The middle term can be estimated
without bias by 
$$\frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{f}^{-i}_h,$$
and this leads to the statistic
$$\mathrm{UCV}(h) = \| \hat{f}_h\|_2^2 - \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{f}^{-i}_h$$
known as the unbiased cross-validation criterion. The corresponding 
bandwidth estimate is 
$$\hat{h}_{\mathrm{UCV}} = \textrm{arg min}_h \ \ \mathrm{UCV}(h).$$
Contrary to the log-likelihood based criterion, this criterion requires 
the computation of $\| \hat{f}_h\|_2^2$. Bandwidth selection using UCV 
is implemented in R in the function `bw.ucv()` and can be 
used with `density()` by setting the argument `bw = "ucv"`. 

## Likelihood considerations {#likelihood}

In Section \@ref(cv) the cross-validated likelihood was used for bandwidth selection. 
It is natural to ask why we did not go all-in and simply maximized the
likelihood over all possible densities to find a maximum likelihood estimator 
instead of using the ad hoc idea behind kernel density estimation.

The log-likelihood
$$\ell(f) = \sum_{i=j}^n \log f(x_j)$$
is well defined as a function of the density $f$ -- even when $f$ is not restricted 
to belong to a finite-dimensional parametric model. 
To investigate if a nonparametric MLE is meaningful we consider how the likelihood
behaves for the densities 
$$\overline{f}_h(x) = \frac{1}{nh \sqrt{2 \pi}} \sum_{j=1}^n e^{- \frac{(x - x_j)^2}{2 h^2} }$$
for different choices of $h$. Note that $\overline{f}_h$ is simply the 
kernel density estimator with the Gaussian kernel and bandwidth $h$. 


```{r gaus-dens}
## The densities can easily be implemented using the density implementation
## of the Gaussian density in R
f_h <- function(x, h) mean(dnorm(x, psi, h))
## This function does not work as a vectorized function as it is, but there is 
## a convenience function, 'Vectorize', in R that turns the function into a 
## function that can actually be applied correctly to a vector. 
f_h <- Vectorize(f_h)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:gausKern) shows what some of 
these densities look like compared to the histogram of the $\psi$-angle data. 
Clearly, for large $h$ these densities are smooth and slowly oscillating, while 
as $h$ gets smaller the densities  become more and more wiggly. As $h \to 0$
the densities become increasingly dominated by tall narrow peaks 
around the individual data points. 

(ref:gausKern) The densities $\overline{f}_h$ for different choices of $h$. 

```{r gausKern, fig.cap="(ref:gausKern)", fig.show="hold", out.width="49%", dependson=c("gaus-dens", "phipsiLoad"), fig.pos="h", echo=FALSE}
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 1")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 1), add = TRUE, col = "red")
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 0.25")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 0.25), add = TRUE, col = "red", n = 1001)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 0.1")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 0.1), add = TRUE, col = "red", n = 1001)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 0.025")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 0.025), add = TRUE, col = "red", n = 10001)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 0.01")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 0.01), add = TRUE, col = "red", n = 10001)
hist(psi, prob = TRUE, main = "h = 0.0001")
rug(psi)
curve(f_h(x, 0.0001), add = TRUE, col = "red", n = 10001)
```

The way that these densities adapt to the data points is reflected in the 
log-likelihood as well. 

```{r LogLike, dependson=c("phipsiLoad", "gausKern"), fig.cap="Log-likelihood, $\\ell(\\overline{f}_h)$, for the densities $\\overline{f}_h$ as a function of $h$. Note the log-scale on the right.", out.width="49%", fig.show='hold'}
# To plot the log-likelihood we need to evaluate it in a grid of h-values.
hseq <- seq(1, 0.001, -0.001)
# For the following computation of the log-likelihood it is necessary 
# that f_h is vectorized. There are other ways to implement this computation
# in R, and some are more efficient, but the computation of the log-likelihood 
# for each h scales as O(n^2) with n the number of data points. 
ll <- sapply(hseq, function(h) sum(log(f_h(psi, h))))
qplot(hseq, ll, geom = "line") + xlab("h") + ylab("Log-likelihood")
qplot(hseq, ll, geom = "line") + scale_x_log10("h") + ylab("")
```

From Figure \@ref(fig:LogLike) it is clear that the likelihood is decreasing in 
$h$, and it appears that it is unbounded as $h \to 0$. This is most clearly 
seen on the figure when $h$ is plotted on the log-scale because then it appears
that the log-likelihood approximately behaves as $-\log(h)$ for $h \to 0$. 

We can show that that is, indeed, the case. If $x_i \neq x_j$ when $i \neq j$

\begin{align*}
\ell(\overline{f}_h) & = \sum_{i} \log\left(1 + \sum_{j \neq i} e^{-(x_i - x_j)^2 / (2 h^2)} \right) - 
n \log(nh\sqrt{2 \pi}) \\
& \sim - n \log(nh\sqrt{2 \pi})
\end{align*}

for $h \to 0$. Hence, $\ell(\overline{f}_h) \to \infty$ for $h \to 0$. This demonstrates that the MLE 
of the density does not exist in the set of all distributions with densities.

In the sense of [weak convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_measures#Weak_convergence_of_measures) it actually holds that 
$$\overline{f}_h \cdot m \overset{\mathrm{wk}}{\longrightarrow} 
\varepsilon_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n \delta_{x_j}$$
for $h \to 0$. The *empirical measure* $\varepsilon_n$ can sensibly be regarded as 
the nonparametric MLE of the distribution, but the empirical measure does not have 
a density. We conclude that we cannot directly define a sensible 
density estimator as a maximum-likelihood estimator.  

### Method of sieves {#sieves}

A sieve is a family of models, $\Theta_{h}$, indexed by
a real valued parameter, $h \in \mathbb{R}$, such that $\Theta_{h_1} \subseteq \Theta_{h_2}$ for 
$h_1 \leq h_2$. In this chapter $\Theta_{h}$ will denote a set of probability densities. 
If the increasing family of models is chosen in a sensible way, we 
may be able to compute the MLE
$$\hat{f}_h = \text{arg max}_{f \in \Theta_h} \ell(f),$$
and we may even be able to choose $h = h_n$ as a function of the sample size $n$
such that $\hat{f}_{h_n}$ becomes a consistent estimator of $f_0$. 

It is possible to take 
$$\Theta_h = \{ \overline{f}_{h'} \mid h' \leq h \}$$
with $\overline{f}_{h'}$ as defined above, in which case $\hat{f}_h = \overline{f}_h$. 
We will see in the following section that this is simply a kernel estimator. 

A more interesting example is obtained by letting 
$$\Theta_h = \left\{ x \mapsto  \frac{1}{h \sqrt{2 \pi}} \int  e^{- \frac{(x - z)^2}{2 h^2} } \mathrm{d}\mu(z) \Biggm| \mu \textrm{ a probability measure}   \right\},$$
which is known as the convolution sieve. We note that $\overline{f}_h \in \Theta_h$ by 
taking $\mu = \varepsilon_n$, but generally $\hat{f}_h$ will be 
different from $\overline{f}_h$. 

We will not pursue the general theory of sieve estimators, but refer 
to the paper [Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimation by the Method of Sieves](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176345782) by Geman and Hwang. 
In the following section we will work out some more practical details 
for a particular sieve estimator based on a basis expansion of the 
log-density.

### Basis expansions {#basis-density}

We suppose in this section that the data points are all contained in the
interval $[a,b]$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$. This is true for the angle 
data with $a = -\pi$ and $b = \pi$ no matter the size of the data set,
but if $f_0$ does not have a bounded support it may be necessary to let $a$
and $b$ change with the data. However, for any fixed data set we can choose 
some sufficiently large $a$ and $b$. 

In this section the sieve will be indexed by integers,
and for $h \in \mathbb{N}$ we suppose that we have chosen continuous 
functions $b_1, \ldots, b_h : [a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$. These will be 
called *basis functions*. We then define 
$$\Theta_h = \left\{ x \mapsto  \varphi(\boldsymbol{\beta})^{-1} 
\exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^h \beta_k b_k(x)\right) \Biggm| \boldsymbol{\beta} = (\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_h)^T \in \mathbb{R}^h \right\},$$
where 
$$\varphi(\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \int_a^b \exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^h \beta_k b_k(x)\right) \mathrm{d} x.$$

The MLE over $\Theta_h$ is then given as 
$$\hat{f}_h(x) =  \varphi(\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}})^{-1} 
\exp\left(\sum_{k=1}^h \hat{\beta}_k b_k(x)\right),$$
where 

\begin{align*}
\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}} & = 
\text{arg max}_{\boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^h} \ \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^h \beta_k b_k(x_j) - \log \varphi(\boldsymbol{\beta}) \\
& = \text{arg max}_{\boldsymbol{\beta} \in \mathbb{R}^h} \ \ \mathbf{1}^T \mathbf{B} \boldsymbol{\beta} - \log \varphi(\boldsymbol{\beta}).
\end{align*}

Here $\mathbf{B}$ is the $n \times h$ matrix with $B_{jk} = b_k(x_j)$. Thus for 
any fixed $h$ the model is, in fact, just an ordinary parametric exponential
family, though it may not be entirely straightforward how to compute 
$\varphi(\boldsymbol{\beta})$.

Many basis functions are possible. Polynomials may be used, but splines are 
often preferred. An alternative is a selection of trigonometric functions, 
for instance  
$$b_1(x) = \cos(x), b_2(x) = \sin(x), \ldots, b_{2h-1}(x) = \cos(hx),  b_{2h}(x) = \sin(hx)$$
on the interval $[-\pi, \pi]$. In Section \@ref(vM) a simple special case 
was actually treated corresponding to $h = 2$, where the normalization constant 
was identified in terms of a modified Bessel function. 

It is worth remembering the following:

> "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk."
>
> --- John von Neumann

The Normal-inverse Gaussian distribution has four parameters and
the generalized hyperbolic distribution is an extension with five,
but von Neumann was probably thinking more in terms of a 
spline or a polynomial expansion as above with four or five suitably 
chosen basis functions. 

The quote is not a mathematical statement but an empirical observation. 
With a handful of parameters you already have a quite flexible class of 
densities that will fit many real data sets well. But remember 
that a reasonably good fit does not mean
that you have found the "true" data generating model. Though data is 
in some situations not as scarce a resource today as when von Neumann made
elephants wiggle their trunks, the quote still suggests that $h$ should grow
rather slowly with $n$ to avoid overfitting.

## Exercises {#density:ex}

### Kernel density estimation {-}

::: {.exercise #epanechnikov}
The Epanechnikov kernel is given by 
$$K(x) = \frac{3}{4}(1 - x^2)$$
for $x \in [-1, 1]$ and 0 elsewhere. Show that this is a probability density
with mean zero and compute $\sigma_K^2$ as well as $\|K\|_2^2$. 
:::


For the following exercises use the log(F12) variable as considered in 
Exercise \@ref(exr:plotHist).

::: {.exercise #epanechnikov-density}
Use `density()` to compute the kernel density estimate with the Epanechnikov kernel
to the log(F12) data. Try different bandwidths. 
:::

::: {.exercise #epanechnikov-implement}
Implement kernel density estimation yourself using the Epanechnikov kernel. 
Test your implementation by comparing it to `density()` using the log(F12) data.
:::

### Benchmarking {-}

::: {.exercise #benchmark-epanechnikov}
Construct the following vector
:::

```{r xsim}
x <- rnorm(2^13)
```

Then use `microbenchmark` to benchmark the computation of 

```{r density-xsim, eval = FALSE}
density(x[1:k], 0.2)
```

for `k` ranging from $2^5$ to $2^{13}$. Summarize the benchmarking results. 

::: {.exercise #benchmark-own-epanechnikov}
Benchmark your own implementation of kernel density estimation using the Epanechnikov
kernel. Compare the results to those obtained for `density()`. 
:::

::: {.exercise #benchmark-kernel}
Experiment with different implementations of kernel evaluation in R using 
the Gaussian kernel and the Epanechnikov kernel. Use `microbenchmark()` to compare 
the different implementations.
